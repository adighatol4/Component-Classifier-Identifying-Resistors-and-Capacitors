This project appliesmachine learning knowledge to image classification, using a Convolutional
NeuralNetwork (CNN)to classify images ofresistors and capacitors. It preprocesses images,
trains themodel on labeled data, and achieves high accuracy in componenttype prediction. The
project aims to streamline electronic componentidentification processes.
